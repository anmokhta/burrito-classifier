    "This is an **optional** assignment. If you choose to do it, your score on this assignment will replace your lowest homework score. In the event that your score on this assignment is lower than all your homework scores, then your lowest homework score will *not* be replaced, so there is no harm in attempting this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment introduces you to the classification problem in machine learning. We will not cover classification in lecture, but it is covered in your textbook. To start this assignment, you should first read through [Chapter 17 of your textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/17/Classification.html).\n",

    "## 1.1 Getting to Know Our Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset is a table of burrito reviews, collected by [Scott Cole](https://srcole.github.io/100burritos/), a data scientist in San Diego. The data was collected via a form that burrito eaters can fill out to give their impressions of a particular burrito. The burrito reviewer scores their burrito in ten different dimensions or features, such as volume, quality of fillings, quality of meat, etc. In addition, two summary ratings are included: whether you'd recommend the burrito to a friend, and an overall rating on a scale of 0 to 5. Cole's dataset contains over 350 burrito reviews, and if you want to contribute to his data science project by reviewing a burrito, just [fill out the form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWAkbSKzHydtzJ-AKHp_rXKHeG80cZuUBjyEeMAUZXJsiFKQ/viewform).\n",
    "\n",
    "For your reference, we include the full description of the ten features, quoted from [Cole's website](https://srcole.github.io/100burritos/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Contrary to popular belief, burritos do not merely exist in 3 dimensions. They transcend the physical limitations of space. From polling several San Diegans, we’ve established the 10 core dimensions of the San Diego burrito.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Volume** - “size matters,” “bigger is better,” or whatever your favorite innuendo is fits because there’s nothing more disconcerting than ordering a burrito and not being full.\n",
    "2. **Tortilla quality**\n",
    "3. **Temperature** - the Goldilocks zone\n",
    "4. **Meat quality**\n",
    "5. **Non-meat filling quality**\n",
    "6. **Meat:filling** - The ratio between meat and non-meat. Perhaps the golden ratio: 1.6180339887...\n",
    "7. **Uniformity** - Bites full of sour cream and cheese with no meat are disappointing.\n",
    "8. **Salsa quality** - and variety!\n",
    "9. **Flavor synergy** - \"That magical aspect a great burrito has, making everything come together like it is a gift from the skies\" - A wise Dutchman\n",
    "10. **Wrap integrity** - you ordered a burrito, not a burrito bowl.   \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these measures (except for Volume) are rated on a scale from 0 to 5, 0 being terrible, and 5 being optimal. In the future, Meat:Filling and Temperature measures may stray from this subjective scale in order to better quantify these two valuable burrito characteristics. Additionally, acquisition of a portable scale will allow collection of mass. Cost (in USD) and hunger level (on the same 0-5 scale) are measured as potential control factors. In addition to these 10 core dimensions, we also collect two summary statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overall rating - 0 to 5 stars\n",
    "* Recommendation - Yes/No. If a friend asked you about that burrito with the intent of purchasing one, would you recommend it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will be trying to classify whether or not a burrito is recommended or not, based on it's scores in the ten features. \n",

    "Suppose Alice is a new patient who is not in the data set. If I tell you Alice’s hemoglobin level and blood glucose level, could you predict whether she has CKD? Probably, you could. You would plot Alice's location on the axes above. If she fell in the lower-right region, you would predict that she did not have CKD, and otherwise you would predict that she did have CKD. \n",
    "\n",
    "The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is based on the intuitive idea that Alice should be put into the same category (CKD or no CKD) as people whose Hemoglobin and Glucose are similar to hers. To classify Alice as CKD or not, we find the patient in the training set who is “nearest” to Alice, and then use that patient’s diagnosis as our prediction for Alice. The intuition is that if two points are near each other in the scatterplot, then the corresponding measurements are pretty similar, so we might expect them to receive the same diagnosis (more likely than not). \n",

If we choose `k` to be an odd number, then one of the two classes will be a majority among Alice's `k` neighbors.

    "In the first chart, a meat rating of 1 corresponds to an average overall rating of around `2.0` but a meat rating of 5 has an average overall rating of around `4.5`. This is a `2.5` point difference! \n",
    "\n",
    "Now compare this to the second chart. If the temperature of the burrito is (horrifically) low, say a 1, the average overall rating is around `3.0` and when the temperature is a solid 5 out of 5, the average overall rating is about `4.0`. This is only a `1` point difference!\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope of a line represents how much the variable on the vertical axis (overall rating, in this case) changes with a unit change in the horizontal axis. The first chart shows that when a reviewer increases their meat rating by one point, the overall rating goes up by about `0.6`, whereas the second chart shows that when a reviewer increases their temperature rating by one point, the overall rating goes up by only about `0.25`. That is, meat is a more important factor in determining the overall rating of a burrito than temperature."

Also, we can carefully select features, like what we did in section 3; if you select the features that matter most for the burritos, you'll be more likely to get an accurate prediction. We can include more features to get better predictions, or change the value of `k` that we used. Alternatively, we could even turn to a completely different classifier altogether (non KNN)!"
